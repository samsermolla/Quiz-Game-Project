# Quiz-Game-Project
Developing a Quiz Game is also a worthwhile option for all the beginners who are looking forward to building a web development project. In this project, what you have to do is create a web page that will show several multiple-choice options with 4 options and the result of the quiz will be displayed at the end when the user will submit the test. You need to use your HTML skills to set up the structure and CSS skills to make the page look more engaging and creative. The JavaScript will be responsible for tasks like â€“ identifying if the answer is correct or not, responding accordingly for correct &amp; wrong answers, displaying the result on submit, etc. in this project. You will get to learn various fundamental concepts such as DOM manipulation, eventListeners, arrays, etc. while working on this project.
